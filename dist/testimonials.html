        <div class="quote">
          <p>Rankin Construction was a valuable member of our team at The Alexander at Patroon Creek, in Albany, NY. Bringing them on board early was extremely helpful, as they had helpful insight and worked well with our architect and engineers during the finalization of the drawings. Rankin provided framing, vinyl siding and roofing labor on our almost $50 million apartment project and the final product is something we are very proud of.</p>

          <p>From the initial planning and pricing to the final days of completion, Rankin Construction’s team was enthusiastic, energetic, honest and knowledgeable. In addition, their crews and subcontractors were punctual, pleasant and highly skilled. The work was completed in a timely fashion, and the results were what we have come to expect from their professional organization. We would highly recommend Rankin Construction to anyone interested and look forward to the opportunity to work with them again in the future.</p>

          <p>Rankin Construction did a great job on the Grand Treviso jobsite for Turner Construction. The quality and quantity of manpower was an excellent factor. I will highly recommend Rankin Construction on other jobs that Turner will have in the future.</p>
